	<h2>CULTURE NIGHT CORK 2021</h2>
		<p>Despite the challenges this year for Culture Night, organisers and venues have created over 100 events, a huge testament to the creativity and dedication of the Arts Sector in Cork.</p><br>
		<p>Many events take place here online â€“ livestreams, pieces pre-recorded specially for the night, or file footage to enjoy. But there are also some live in-person events happening in venues around the city, both indoors and outdoors.</p><br>
		<p>Each venue is obliged to follow the regulations &#038; guidelines relevant to their premises and their event, with the best interest of patrons, artists and staff at the heart of planning. </p><br>
		<p>Your patience and support is appreciated.</p><br>
